Generators
============================

Generator can be thought of as a generalized RTL design, written using a mix of meta-programming and standard RTL.
This type of meta-programming is enabled by the Chisel hardware description language (see :ref:`Chisel`).
A standard RTL design is essentially just a single instance of a design coming from a generator.
However, by using meta-programming and parameter systems, generators can allow for integration of complex hardware designs in automated ways.
The following pages introduce the generators integrated with the Chipyard framework.
